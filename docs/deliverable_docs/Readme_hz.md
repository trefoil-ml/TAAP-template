# docs/deliverable_docs
This folder gives us a single point to store final versions of customer or conference presentations related to this engagement. As the repo will become large if you store Word, ppt, etc. files (especially if these are changing over time), please only store final documents here and utilize another location such as a Connections (or similar resource) for working documents of that nature.

## Project Report
The [project_report.md](project_report.md) contains the primary deliverable for the client. It contains the vital information about the project, its findings, architecture, results, and summary of outputs and artifacts.
